            <p><b><h3>WEB DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE</h3></b></p>
               <p>            My development experience was not too hard because the lecturer had given us almost everything
                 required to perform the task. It was easy to add headers, footers lists, anchors, e.t.c. Creating
                 different branches made my work easy and fastened the process.However, I still had to find solutions
                 from other reliable sources in areas I found difficult like in adding animations and making the dropdown menu. </p>

        <div class="module-container">
            <p><b><h3>MODULE EXPERIENCE</h3></b></p>
               <p> The module was very interactive and fun despite it was done virtually.The tutor brought in class activities 
                   to ensure maximum participation. He also gave well-documented and comprehensive slides and video. I would say that
                   we were given more than required because they were self-explanatory.
