            <p><b><h3>WEB DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE</h3></b></p>
               <p>            My development experience was not too hard because the lecturer had given us almost everything
                 required to perform the task. It was easy to add headers, footers lists, anchors, e.t.c. Creating
                 different branches made my work easy and fastened the process.However, I still had to find solutions
                 from other reliable sources in areas I found difficult like in adding animations and making the dropdown menu. </p>
            </div>

        <div class="module-container">
            <p><b><h3>MODULE EXPERIENCE</h3></b></p>
               <p> The module was very interactive and fun despite it was done virtually.The tutor brought in class activities 
                   to ensure maximum participation. He also gave well-documented and comprehensive slides and video. I would say that
                   we were given more than required because they were self-explanatory. 
               </p>

        <div class="report-container">
            <p><b><h3>DEVELOPMENT REPORT</h3></b></p>
            
                Firstly, The student tried to understand the task given and searched for samples from the internet of how the portfolio would look like.
                In order to have a mind map and I officially started the project on the first week of november. </p>
            <p><b><u><h4>November 2-8(first week):</h4></u></b></p>This week I started deciding the fonts, colors, pictures that I would use to build my website
             and I made a rough sketch of how I wanted my portfolio to look like.</br>
            

            
             <p><b><u><h4>November 9-15(second week):</h4></u></b></p> I started writing my css file and initializing effects that I would want in my portfolio 
             like the container, columns and buttons. I kept adjusting the container size to make sure it fits well<img src="code2.jpg" height="20" width="15"> <img src="code1.jpg" height="20" width="15">
             
             
            
             <p><b><u><h4>November 16-22(Third week):</h4></u></b></p>I tried different samples and different font to see which matches better. Initially, I wanted to 
             use a black layout for my portfolio, then a lemon but I found out that white would be the best fit. I also created a fixed menu at the top to go across pages.
             <img src="blackport.jpg" height="700" width="50">   <img src="lemonport.jpg" height="20" width="15">
            

            
            <p><b><u><h4>November 23-29(Fourth week):</h4></u></b></p> I tried to add transitions, social media bar and button just to make my portfolio more fancy which I achieved with
            the help of a youtube video(Going-To Internet, 2018).
            <img src="transition1.jpg" height="20" width="15"> <img src="transition2.jpg" height="20" width="15">
            
             
            <p><b><u><h4>November 30- Dec 6(Fifth week):</h4></u></b></p>I had my first commit, I decided to start saving  my work because I was done
            with the portfolio and home page then I started creating other pages using the same layouts ans similar css codes. I createad a form that has features like 
            checkboxes, options, radio e.t.c with help from the module slides.

            <p><b><u><h4>December 7-13(sixth week):</h4></u></b></p>I tried to add the hamburger icon first on my portfolio with the (shownav) code that is available on the module slides.
            But I was not able to make it appear only on mobile phone so I had to create another css file and add a conditional statement using screen sizes as to make it appear only on mobile phones.
            <img src="cssscreenshot.jpg" height="20" width="15"> <img src="hamburgerscheenshot.jpg" height="20" width="15"> 
        
            <p><b><u><h4>December 14-20(seventh week):</h4></u></b></p>This week I was editting my menu so it will have a different design on mobiles(horizontal on desktops while vertical on mobiles)
            and I attempted making a video on how I created my web portfolio but i was not done yet.
             
            <p><b><u><h4>Dec 28-Jan 3(seventh week):</h4></u></b></p>I completed my video andI started adding comments and other finishing touches on my work to make my codes easier to understand
